- Data Carpentry (& Software Carpentry - both fantastic!) have some lessons, including on sorting out your data to make it easier to include [in R](http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/). They also have a good [R lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/) if interested.
